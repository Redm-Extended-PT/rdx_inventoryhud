## Installation
You need to do a couple steps to get it working.
First you ensure adding the resources to your server.cfg

- Put all folders in your resources folder and ensure:
```
ensure rdx_core
ensure cron
ensure rdx_addonaccount
ensure rdx_addoninventory
ensure rdx_datastore
ensure rdx_inventoryhud
```

## Usage

- Press U for your personal inventory.
- Press ESC to close your personal inventory.

### Disable default rdx inventory:

Open rdx_core, then find and remove this code in `client/main.lua`:
```
-- Menu interactions
Citizen.CreateThread(function()
	while true do

		Citizen.Wait(0)

		if IsControlJustReleased(0, Keys['*******']) and IsInputDisabled(0) and not isDead and not RDX.UI.Menu.IsOpen('default', 'redm_extended', 'inventory') then
			RDX.ShowInventory()
		end

	end
